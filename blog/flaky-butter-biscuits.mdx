## Introduction

These flaky butter biscuits are a classic American comfort food that everyone should know how to make. They're perfect for breakfast with jam and butter, as a side to soup or stew, or even as the base for biscuits and gravy.

The secret to flaky biscuits is keeping the butter cold and not overworking the dough. These biscuits will rise tall and have beautiful, tender layers that practically melt in your mouth.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients (mix in one bowl):
- 300g All Purpose Flour
- 15g Baking powder
- 10g Granulated sugar
- 5g Salt

### Wet Ingredients:
- 170g Butter (grated, frozen)
- 170g Buttermilk (cold)

### Optional Additions:
- 100g Cheddar cheese, grated
- 50g Scallions, finely chopped

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Butter

Grate the butter using a box grater and place it in the freezer for at least 15 minutes. This ensures the butter stays cold and creates those beautiful flaky layers.

> **Tip:** You can also freeze the butter for 30 minutes and then cut it into small cubes, but grating works best for even distribution.

### Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt until well combined.

### Step 3: Add Cold Butter

Add the frozen grated butter to the dry ingredients. Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour until you have pea-sized pieces. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.

> **Important:** Don't overwork the butter! You want to see small pieces of butter throughout the mixture.

### Step 4: Add Optional Ingredients

If using cheese and scallions, add them now and gently toss to distribute evenly.

### Step 5: Add Buttermilk

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the cold buttermilk. Using a fork or wooden spoon, gently stir until the dough just comes together. The dough will be shaggy and sticky - this is perfect!

### Step 6: Shape the Dough

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat it into a rectangle about 1 inch (2.5cm) thick. Don't knead the dough - just pat it together.

### Step 7: Fold and Layer

Fold the dough in half like a book, then pat it out again to 1 inch thick. Repeat this folding process 2-3 times to create layers. This is what gives the biscuits their flaky texture!

### Step 8: Cut the Biscuits

Using a sharp biscuit cutter or a floured glass, cut out the biscuits. Press straight down - don't twist! Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart.

### Step 9: Bake

Preheat your oven to 425Â°F (220Â°C). Bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes until they're golden brown on top and have risen tall.

### Step 10: Serve

Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving. Best enjoyed warm with butter and jam!

## Tips for Perfect Biscuits

### Keep Everything Cold
- Use cold buttermilk straight from the fridge
- Keep the butter frozen until you're ready to use it
- Work quickly to prevent the butter from melting

### Don't Overwork the Dough
- Mix just until the ingredients come together
- Handle the dough as little as possible
- Pat, don't knead!

### Baking Tips
- Use a sharp cutter for clean edges
- Don't twist when cutting - this seals the edges and prevents rising
- Space biscuits close together for support as they rise
- Bake until golden brown - underbaked biscuits will be doughy

## Variations

### Sweet Biscuits
- Increase sugar to 25g
- Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Serve with fresh berries and whipped cream

### Herbed Biscuits
- Add 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, or chives)
- Perfect with savory dishes

### Cheese Biscuits
- Add 100g grated cheddar cheese
- Sprinkle extra cheese on top before baking
- Great with soup or chili

## Storage

### Fresh Biscuits
- Best eaten the day they're made
- Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days
- Reheat in a 350Â°F (175Â°C) oven for 5-7 minutes

### Freezing
- Freeze unbaked biscuits on a baking sheet
- Once frozen, transfer to a freezer bag
- Bake from frozen, adding 2-3 minutes to baking time

## Serving Suggestions

These biscuits are incredibly versatile:

- **Breakfast**: With butter, jam, or honey
- **Brunch**: As the base for eggs Benedict
- **Lunch**: With soup or salad
- **Dinner**: As a side to roasted chicken or beef
- **Dessert**: With fresh fruit and whipped cream

## Troubleshooting

### Biscuits Too Dense
- You may have overworked the dough
- Make sure your baking powder is fresh
- Don't overmix the wet and dry ingredients

### Biscuits Don't Rise
- Check that your baking powder is fresh
- Make sure the oven is fully preheated
- Don't twist the cutter when cutting

### Biscuits Too Dry
- Add a bit more buttermilk
- Don't overbake - remove when golden brown
